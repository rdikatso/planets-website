## My process

### Built with

- Sass
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

-Using smaller components for the project?
-Continue with better organization of sass files.
-Next project I should use mobile first workflow.
-I can refine styling of some elements for example the border-top for active link shifts it lower.
